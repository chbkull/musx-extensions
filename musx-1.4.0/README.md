# MUSX

musx (pronounced *muse ex*) is a Python3 package for composing and processing symbolic music information.  The software contains most of the compositional tools and demo materials found in my software packages Common Music and Grace, including support for complex pattern generation, randomness, mapping, enveloping, spectral composition, and microtonality.  

See INSTALL.md for directions on installing musx. Once installed, you can learn about musx by working with its demo scripts and reading the documentation, both of which are included in this distribution.

musx was created as a reference implementation for teaching MUS499 MRC, a course for students in the CS+Music degree program here who are interested in designing and building their own composition systems. If you are interested in developing the musx source code, please contact me.
